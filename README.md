The Vape Subscription Website is a modern web application built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and Bootstrap. It offers a subscription service for users interested in exploring tobacco-free vape products. The website features an engaging homepage that introduces the service and provides multiple subscription plans to choose from. Users can opt for plans tailored to their needs, such as the "Smoker" plan for those transitioning from smoking to vaping or the "Winner" plan for lucky winners of promotions.

The website also includes an "About Us" page, giving insights into the company's mission and values. To facilitate payments, the platform features a secure and user-friendly "Payment" page, where customers can enter their details and choose their preferred payment method. After completing the payment process, users receive a detailed "Invoice" page summarizing their subscription details.

The project employs Bootstrap and custom CSS styles for a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Additionally, it uses EJS templates to dynamically render content, making it easier to maintain and update the website. The Vape Subscription Website is designed to provide an excellent user experience and cater to vape enthusiasts seeking a hassle-free subscription service.
